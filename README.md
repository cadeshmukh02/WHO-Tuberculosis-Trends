# WHO Tuberculosis Trends
The project analyzes global tuberculosis (TB) trends and provides insights and recommendations for addressing the TB crisis. It explores burdens, expenditures, budgets, treatment outcomes, and community engagement, with a particular emphasis on the estimated incidence of TB per 100,000 people. This metric is used as a benchmark to compare against other factors in order to evaluate their impact on reducing incidence rates.
